# [sphinx-themes.org](https://sphinx-themes.org)

A Sphinx Themes Gallery, curated by [@pradyunsg] and [@shirou].

This project exists to be a showcase for Sphinx themes and we'd like to include all reusable themes available on PyPI.

## Contributing

If you find new theme on PyPI, please file an issue or, even better, a PR for adding it. Our [Contributing Guide] contains the details for how to add a new theme, how to work on this project and about how this website is generated and hosted.

## Acknowledgements
